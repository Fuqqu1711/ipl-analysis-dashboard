💡 Key DAX Highlights

Examples of DAX measures used:

Total Runs = SUM(Batting[Runs])
Most Sixes = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Batting), Batting[Type] = "6")
Orange Cap = RANKX(ALL(Players), [Total Runs], , DESC)
Total Wickets = COUNT(Wickets[Dismissal Type])
Purple Cap = RANKX(ALL(Bowlers), [Total Wickets], , DESC)
Points = CALCULATE(SUM(Results[Points]))

Over 50+ custom DAX measures were created to:
✔️ Build leaderboards
✔️ Handle dynamic filters
✔️ Apply conditional formatting
✔️ Enable drill-downs by season, team, and player
